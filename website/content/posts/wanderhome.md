Wanderhome is a pastoral fantasy role-playing game about traveling animal-folk, the vibrant world of HÃ¦th they inhabit, and the gentle rhythm of the changing seasons. It evokes a feeling reminiscent of the works of Hayao Miyazaki, Tove Jansson, or Brian Jacques, filled with grassy fields, mossy shrines, friendly bumblebees, and charmingly dressed creatures like opossums in sundresses and salamanders with suspenders. The game focuses on journeys, community, finding a sense of belonging, and the small, beautiful moments of life.
Wanderhome is built on the "Belonging Outside Belonging" game engine. This means it is intentionally rules-light, featuring no dice, no math, no traditional Game Master, and no complicated rules to memorize. Play is driven by evocative text, character playbooks that offer archetypes (like the Shepherd, the Guardian, or the Firefly), and narrative prompts that encourage players to describe their characters' experiences, the places they visit, and their interactions with others. The focus is on collaborative storytelling, creating a shared imaginative space, and exploring the emotional landscapes of the characters and the world. The game is designed to be flexible, suitable for any session length and any number of players.
