Princess with a Cursed Sword is a highly concise solo journaling role-playing game, designed to fit on a single printed page. The player takes on the role of a princess found within ancient ruins, encumbered by a finely made gown and, more significantly, a dark, cursed sword that she cannot relinquish. Her quest is to discover the sword's origins in the hope of finally being freed from its influence. The game encourages the player to write their journal entries in the third person, as if transcribing a fairy tale. This solo game utilizes a standard tarot deck and two coins (or, as an alternative, six-sided dice where odd numbers represent tails and even numbers represent heads). Players explore the ruins by drawing a tarot card; the imagery of the card, in conjunction with game prompts, helps determine what the princess discovers in various locations like stone courts, torchlit dungeons, or overgrown gardens. When the princess faces challenges, the player flips two coins. The outcome of these flips dictates success or failureâ€”success might manifest as the princess displaying supernatural prowess, while failure could mean she staggers or stumbles. A central recurring decision point involves whether the princess will give in to the sword's desires in exchange for wielding its power. The game prompts reflection on the sacrifices the princess might be willing to make to either rid herself of the sword or, perhaps, to embrace what it offers.
