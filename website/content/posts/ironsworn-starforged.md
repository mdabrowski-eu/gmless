Ironsworn: Starforged is a standalone science fiction iteration and evolution of the acclaimed Ironsworn role-playing game. Players assume the roles of spacefaring heroes committed to undertaking perilous quests, known as "iron vows," within a vast and enigmatic galaxy referred to as the Forge. The game involves exploring uncharted regions of space, uncovering cosmic secrets, and forging significant relationships with characters encountered during their travels. Thematic inspirations are drawn from a range of science fiction media, including The Mandalorian, the original Star Wars trilogy, Firefly, Alien, Dune, and Battlestar Galactica. Starforged employs a system of narrative-driven "moves," inspired by the Apocalypse World engine, to resolve actions that are dangerous or have uncertain outcomes. When a player character makes such a move, the player rolls an action die (a d6) and compares it against two challenge dice (ten-sided dice, or $d10$s). The results of this roll determine the outcome: a "strong hit" (full success), a "weak hit" (success but with a cost, complication, or partial effect), or a "miss" (failure, often leading to significant negative consequences that drive the story forward).
The game is versatile in its play modes, explicitly supporting solo play, cooperative play (GM-less with multiple players), and guided play (with one player acting as a traditional Game Master). A hallmark of the system is its extensive array of oracles and random generators. These tools allow for the on-the-fly creation of planets, space stations, NPCs, alien creatures, starships, ancient derelicts, and more, effectively eliminating the need for advance preparation by a GM or solo player. Players track their character's statistics, resources (such as health, spirit, supply), and progress on vows using a character sheet. As they complete quests, make discoveries, and form bonds, they gain experience, which can be spent to acquire "assets"—these include vehicles, starship modules, character paths or skills, companions, and significant deeds—that enhance their abilities and narrative options.
