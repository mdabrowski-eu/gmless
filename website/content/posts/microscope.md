Microscope is a "fractal" role-playing game where a group of 2-4 players collaboratively creates and explores an epic history of their own design, spanning hundreds or even thousands of years, all within a single afternoon session. Players might chart the rise and fall of a galactic civilization, chronicle the history of a fledgling nation emerging from imperial ruins, or detail the slow fading of magic as an ancient line of dragon-kings dies out.
The game is notable for having no GM and requiring no advance preparation. Players begin by defining the broad scope of their history: a starting point (the "Beginning Period") and an ending point (the "Ending Period"). They also establish elements that are present throughout the entire history (the "Palette"). From there, players take turns adding new historical elements—"Periods" (large eras), "Events" (significant occurrences within a Period), or "Scenes" (specific moments or interactions within an Event)—to a shared timeline. Crucially, players are not bound by chronological order; they can jump backward or forward in time to add details to any part of the history that interests them. For example, a player might define a war in one turn, then in a later turn, jump back decades to explore the childhood of a key figure in that war. Players can "zoom out" to define sweeping historical trends or "zoom in" to role-play specific scenes, taking on characters within those moments. The game encourages players to build upon, and sometimes dramatically alter, the contributions of others.
