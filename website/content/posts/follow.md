Follow is a GMless game about a group of characters undertaking a quest or pursuing a shared goal. The game focuses on the fellowship itself, their relationships, and the challenges they face together, whether they ultimately succeed or fail in their objective.
Players collaboratively define their group, their goal, and the obstacles they might face. Play proceeds through scenes, with players taking turns to frame scenes focusing on their own character or the group as a whole. The game uses a simple dice mechanic (often involving rolling a pool of d6s) when characters attempt something risky related to their skills or the quest. Outcomes are typically on a spectrum of success, success with a cost, or failure, driving the narrative forward. The game is structured to build towards a climax and resolution regarding the fellowship's quest.
