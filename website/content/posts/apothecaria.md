Apothecaria is a solo journaling role-playing game in which the player assumes the character of a village witch. The core activity involves creating potions to aid various local inhabitants—villagers, adventurers, and even monsters—who seek assistance for a multitude of unique ailments such as "Fairy Fever," "Candlesick," and "Yeti Chest." The game strives for a humorous, cozy, and wondrous atmosphere, drawing inspiration from media like Theme Hospital, Stardew Valley, and Studio Ghibli films. Designed for solo play, Apothecaria requires a standard deck of playing cards (including Jokers), a journal, and a writing implement. Gameplay revolves around drawing cards, which likely trigger prompts or events related to villagers seeking aid, ingredient gathering, or local happenings. The player responds to these prompts by writing in their journal, developing stories, chronicling encounters (e.g., with "thieving fairies" or "sleeping giants"), and devising potion recipes. This journal becomes a personalized artifact of play. Apothecaria is intended as a long-term game, allowing the player to gradually develop their character, the village, and its inhabitants. An underlying narrative element involves discovering what happened to a missing witch, providing a longer-term goal.
