IronValley is described as a "cozy solo ttrpg hack" of the well-regarded Ironsworn and Ironsworn: Starforged systems. In this game, players embody an individual relocating to a small, welcoming community to begin a new chapter in their life. Potential activities include restoring a family farm, exploring a mysterious nearby forest, developing relationships, and perhaps even falling in love. The game's thematic focus is on "living a cozy life with good company, one day at a time," drawing inspiration from popular life and farming simulation video games such as Animal Crossing, Story of Seasons (Harvest Moon), and Stardew Valley. The game adapts the "moves" structure from the Ironsworn system, simplifying them for a cozier experience. A central mechanical and thematic element is "making and keeping promises"â€”to oneself, to friends, or even to "frienemies". Time progresses as the player takes actions, emphasizing daily routines and goals. Players can significantly customize their version of the Valley using "world truths," which define aspects like the technological level (e.g., medieval village versus contemporary rural town) and the nature of its inhabitants (e.g., adorable animals or fantastical ancestries). The game boasts over pages of "cozy oracles" designed to provide inspiration, generate plot hooks, and help create characters and events. Relationship development with "Townies" is a key feature, facilitated by a gift-giving system where players earn "favor" and can unlock "heart events." Gameplay includes options for farming, foraging, establishing a shop, and raising various types of livestock, including fantastical creatures like slimes or "Beaver Weavers".
