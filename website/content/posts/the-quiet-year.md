The Quiet Year is a distinctive map-drawing game. Players collaboratively narrate the story of a community striving to rebuild and survive during a single "quiet year" following the collapse of civilization. This period of relative peace is finite, as the community knows that the mysterious "Frost Shepherds" will inevitably arrive, bringing an uncertain future. The game is often described as part roleplaying game and part "cartographic poetry," as the shared map becomes a living document of the community's struggles and achievements.
The game is played without a GM, using a standard deck of playing cards, with each card representing one week of the quiet year. Each suit corresponds to a season, and drawing a card triggers specific events or introduces narrative promptsâ€”bringing good news, portents of trouble, project developments, or sudden shifts in fortune. On their turn, a player draws a card, interprets its prompt, makes a decision for the community (such as starting a project, addressing a problem, or exploring a new area), and then physically draws or annotates these developments onto a shared map. This map, which starts largely blank, evolves throughout the game, becoming a rich visual record of the community's story. The game mechanics encourage discussion and sometimes disagreement about the community's priorities. "Contempt tokens" are a notable mechanic allowing players to express a character's unspoken disagreement with a community decision, which can have narrative repercussions later. The game concludes after all cards are drawn, signifying the arrival of the Frost Shepherds.
