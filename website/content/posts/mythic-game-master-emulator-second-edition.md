Mythic GME is not a standalone RPG but a system-agnostic tool designed to enable solo or GMless group play for virtually any other role-playing game. It provides a framework for answering questions, generating unexpected events, and managing NPC behavior, effectively emulating the functions of a human Game Master.
The core of Mythic GME is its "Fate Chart" and a series of oracle tables. When players need to know something that would typically be determined by a GM (e.g., "Is the door locked?" "Does the guard notice us?"), they formulate a yes/no question, assess the likelihood based on context (from "Impossible" to "Sure Thing"), and roll percentile dice against the Fate Chart. The result provides a "yes," "no," "exceptional yes," or "exceptional no," often with the possibility of a random event occurring. Random event tables cover various subjects and actions, introducing twists and turns. The system also includes mechanics for managing scene structure and tracking "Chaos" levels, which influence the likelihood of unexpected events.
