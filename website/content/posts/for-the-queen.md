For the Queen is a card-based story-building game where players take on the roles of loyal attendants accompanying their Queen on a long and perilous journey to broker an alliance with a distant power. The game is designed to collaboratively explore themes of love, loyalty, duty, betrayal, and doubt as players answer evocative prompt cards about their characters' relationships with the Queen and with each other.
Designed for 2-6 players, For the Queen can be set up and played in minutes. Gameplay involves players taking turns drawing cards from a deck of prompt cards. Each card poses a question or presents a statement about the Queen or the journey (e.g., "The Queen has a secret. What is it, and how do you know?" or "Another nation has offered you a title and riches if you betray the Queen. Do you consider it?"). The player who drew the card answers from their character's perspective, building upon the shared narrative. The game continues in this fashion, with players weaving a collective story through their answers. The game includes different illustrations of Queens to inspire the central figure of the story, or players can imagine their own. An "X-Card" is included as a safety tool, allowing any player to edit or remove content they find uncomfortable, ensuring a safer space for exploring potentially sensitive themes. The game typically concludes when the specific card "The Queen is under attack. Will you defend her?" is drawn for the final time, or when all prompt cards have been used.
