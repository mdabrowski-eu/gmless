Anamnesis is a solo journaling role-playing game focused on themes of self-discovery, introspection, and the construction of identity. The player steps into the role of an individual who awakens with profound memory lossâ€”they do not recall who they are, their location, or what they hold dear. The game is a journey of filling in these narrative blanks, exploring the character's forgotten past, and uncovering aspects of their present self. The central mechanic of Anamnesis involves drawing tarot cards. These cards are not used for traditional divination but serve as evocative prompts that guide the player in exploring and defining their character's lost memories and evolving identity. Players record their thoughts, memories, and the unfolding story in a journal. Importantly, no prior familiarity with tarot reading is necessary to play the game. A typical session of Anamnesis is estimated to take between to hours. The objective is not to win or lose, but to collaboratively (with the prompts) tell a compelling story and discover the identity of the character being portrayed. The game can also function as a character creation tool for other role-playing games.
