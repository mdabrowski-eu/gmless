Alone Among the Stars is a solo (though adaptable for 1+ players) tabletop role-playing game centered on the themes of space exploration and the experience of witnessing wondrous, alien sights. Players assume the role of a solitary adventurer navigating the cosmos, visiting diverse and often mysterious worlds, and documenting their unique discoveries and experiences. The game employs an extremely minimalist ruleset, requiring only a standard 52-card deck and a single six-sided die (d6). To discover a new planet or system to explore, the player rolls the d6. The result of this roll dictates the number of cards the player draws from the deck and places face down. Each of these drawn cards then serves as a prompt for a discovery on that planet. The suit of the card typically indicates the general nature of the discovery (e.g., Hearts might signify Ruins, Diamonds could represent Living Beings, Clubs might denote Plants or other immobile life forms), while the rank of the card may further refine the prompt or detail. The player then journals their interpretation of these prompts, usually writing a few sentences per card to describe what their adventurer finds and experiences. The game has no fixed endpoint; it concludes whenever the player decides to cease their explorations.
