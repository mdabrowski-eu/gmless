The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen is a lighthearted, competitive storytelling game. Typically, 3-5 players assume the roles of 18th-century nobles who gather, often in a social setting like a tavern, to regale each other with outrageously exaggerated and improvised tales of their supposed exploits. The game thrives on humor, quick wit, repartee, and good-natured one-upmanship as participants interrupt and challenge the veracity of each other's narratives. The game is GM-less, requires no advance preparation, and a round can be played in under an hour. Players take turns as the active storyteller, often beginning their tale with a prompt (the book provides over such prompts, or players can create their own). As a story unfolds, other players can interject with objections, challenges, or leading questions (e.g., "But Baron, was that before or after you wrestled the crocodile?"). The storyteller must deftly incorporate these interruptions into their narrative or wittily rebuff them. Instead of dice, the game uses "money" (tokens, coins, or even actual currency) and implies the presence of "fine wines" (or other agreed-upon stakes) for wagers. When a challenge is made, wagers can be placed. The flow of these wagers and the collective acclaim of the players determine the "winner" of the round â€“ the player judged to have told the most entertaining and extraordinary tale. The third edition includes several variants, such as simplified rules for younger or inebriated players, and rules for online play.
