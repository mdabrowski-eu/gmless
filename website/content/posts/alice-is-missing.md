Alice is Missing is a unique and immersive silent role-playing game centered on the mysterious disappearance of Alice Briarwood, a high school junior from the sleepy Northern California town of Silent Falls. Players take on the roles of Alice's friends and acquaintances, piecing together clues about her fate in real-time. The game is lauded as "hauntingly beautiful, deeply personal, and highly innovative," with a strong emphasis on emotional engagement.
The game is played entirely via text messages over a single session lasting approximately two to three hours, with minutes dedicated to the core gameplay after an initial 45-minute character and relationship setup phase. There is no formal GM, though one player acts as a facilitator, explaining the rules and managing game components. Players create their characters, define their relationships with Alice and with each other, and then communicate exclusively through a group chat and individual text messages on their phones. This simulates the characters being in different locations and reacting to events as they unfold. Timed "Clue cards" are revealed at set intervals, introducing new pieces of information, potential leads, or dramatic twists that players must react to, driving the investigation and the narrative forward. The game's silent, text-based nature creates a palpable sense of tension and immediacy. The emotional intensity of the game is a key feature, and it's often recommended for groups comfortable exploring potentially difficult themes.
