Fiasco is a game of "powerful ambition and poor impulse control," designed to emulate cinematic tales of small-time capers that spiral disastrously out of control. Think of films like Fargo, Burn After Reading, or A Simple Plan. Players collaboratively create and enact stories about characters with ill-conceived schemes that inevitably, and often hilariously, go wrong, usually culminating in dark comedic outcomes.
This GM-less game is designed for 3-5 players and can be played in a few hours using standard six-sided dice and requiring no advance preparation. The game revolves around "Playsets," which provide a specific scenario (e.g., a suburban cul-de-sac, a Wild West boomtown, an Antarctic research station). Players use dice to collaboratively establish relationships between their characters and key details like needs, objects, and locations relevant to the chosen playset. The narrative unfolds in two acts. Players take turns establishing and resolving scenes for their characters. Halfway through, a "Tilt" phase introduces unexpected complications or disasters, escalating the chaos. The game concludes with an "Aftermath," where players use dice once more to determine the often grim or ironic fates of their characters. The original "Classic" edition primarily uses index cards for tracking elements, while the newer boxed set streamlines setup using custom playing cards.
