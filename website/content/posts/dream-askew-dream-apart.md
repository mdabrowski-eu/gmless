This book contains two games that use the "Belonging Outside Belonging" engine. Dream Askew is set in a queer enclave during the apocalypse, focusing on community, survival, and relationships amidst societal collapse. Dream Apart explores the lives and experiences of Jews in a fantastical, historical Eastern European shtetl, dealing with themes of diaspora, tradition, and community identity.
Both games are GMless and diceless, relying on the "Belonging Outside Belonging" system. Players choose playbooks that define their characters' roles and motivations within the community. Narrative authority is distributed; players take turns framing scenes, introducing conflicts, and describing outcomes based on established setting elements and character desires. Tokens are often used to manage narrative control or highlight specific character aspects or community tensions. The mechanics are designed to generate stories about relationships, community struggles, and identity.
