Polaris is a story game designed to create a tragic fable. It centers on the knights of the dwindling Order of the Stars, who are the last bastion of their people against demonic forces emerging from a cosmic wound known as "the Mistake." The game emphasizes the themes of fading hope, duty, sacrifice, and the inevitable demise of the knights and their world.
Polaris is a GMless game, ideally for four players, where the traditional responsibilities of a GM are distributed and rotate among the participants for each scene. In any given scene, one player is the "Heart," whose protagonist is the focus. The player opposite them is the "Mistaken," controlling the environment, antagonists, and demonic forces, essentially advocating against the protagonist's success. The players to either side of the Heart take on the roles of "New Moon" (controlling close personal relationships) and "Full Moon" (controlling distant or professional relationships), and also act as referees for certain interactions. A distinctive feature of Polaris is its resolution mechanic: instead of dice or cards, the game is played through the ritualized use of specific "key phrases" exchanged between players to determine outcomes and advance the narrative. A full game is intended to be played over several sessions, typically totaling 12-40 hours.
