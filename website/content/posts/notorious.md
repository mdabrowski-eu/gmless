Notorious is a solo role-playing game that casts the player as a "Nomad," a bounty hunter operating within a science fiction universe heavily inspired by media such as Star Wars and other space operas. Nomads in this setting adhere to a particular code of conduct, but players have the agency to deviate from this code, understanding that such choices will likely lead to narrative consequences. The game is centered around the pursuit and capture of targets across various planets. Players manage three primary attributes for their Nomad: Notoriety (reputation on the current planet), Favour (standing with the Nomad's Guild), and Motivation (a resource that can be spent to re-roll dice). Interactions with Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are guided by four potential "Reactions": Speak, Attack, Threaten, and Recruit. The success of these reactions is determined by rolling a Nomad die (a six-sided die, or d6) and adding relevant attribute modifiers, then comparing this to a Challenge die (another d6).
Character creation involves selecting a class (e.g., The Armour, The Assassin, The Scoundrel), which comes with a basic loadout of weapons and armor. Players also randomly determine their character's Origins, Scars (visible traits that can affect interactions), Triggers (elements that might cause deviation from the Nomad code), Species, and Personality. The core gameplay loop consists of an Exploration phase (rolling on tables to generate events, potentially finding Leads to the target), followed by travel to Destinations (which lead to further encounters). This loop repeats, with the likelihood of finding a Lead increasing with Notoriety. Eventually, this process culminates in a Showdown with the target. Showdowns are framed by narratively defined "Sites" (unique locations) and "Settings" (conditions at the site).
