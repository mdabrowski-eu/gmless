ARTEFACT is a contemplative story game designed for a single player. In a departure from typical RPGs that focus on adventurers, this game shifts the narrative perspective to that of a single magical item. Players chronicle the item's extensive history as it passes through the possession of numerous, often short-lived, "Keepers" across vast stretches of time. The game explores themes of endurance, loss, and rediscovery from the viewpoint of this enduring object. Played solo, ARTEFACT benefits from journaling materials, optional art supplies for sketching, and ideally a quiet environment that can be darkened to enhance its contemplative mood. The player begins by choosing an archetype for their Artefact (options include The Weapon, The Shield, The Instrument, The Tome, etc.), sketching its appearance, and defining its magical properties and origins. The game then progresses through cycles: the Artefact is acquired by a "Keeper," and the player answers prompts about this Keeper, their life, and the role the Artefact played during their time together. The Artefact itself has limited agency but can influence its Keepers through its magical nature or perceived will. Between Keepers, the Artefact enters a period of "Rest," during which the player decides how much time elapses and what events or changes occur in the world around the inert item. This cycle of acquisition, use, and rest continues until the Artefact is perhaps finally lost, broken, or abandoned forever. The game can also serve as a creative tool to generate richly detailed histories for magical items intended for use in other TTRPGs, such as Dungeons & Dragons.
