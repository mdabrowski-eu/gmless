Koriko: A Magical Year is a single-player fantasy tabletop role-playing game. It draws significant inspiration from the animated film Kiki's Delivery Service. In the game, the player narrates the story of a young witch during their inaugural year living in a new city. This year is a period of growth, where the witch endeavors to hone their magical abilities, forge new friendships, navigate challenges, and learn more about themselves and the world. The game's narrative is structured around the progression of the four seasons, and letter writing is an integral component of the experience. Koriko utilizes a combination of dice, a standard tarot deck, and a journal for its gameplay. The game is divided into seven distinct "Volumes," each typically requiring 1-2 hours to complete, and these Volumes guide the player through the changing seasons of the witch's year. For each Volume, the player constructs a "Volume Deck" from their tarot deck; drawing cards from this specialized deck provides the primary story prompts. The suits of the tarot cards generally offer situational or thematic prompts, while the Major Arcana cards are used to introduce "confidantes"â€”significant non-player characters who will play important roles in the witch's year.
A unique mechanic in Koriko involves dice stacking for resolving "risky" prompts and "Twists" (special events or challenges). When a player chooses a risky course of action or encounters a Twist, they must physically stack a certain number of dice, with the quantity often related to the character's skill level in the relevant area. Success or failure of the risky action depends on whether this dice tower remains standing. Failure, such as the tower toppling, is not merely a setback but often leads to interesting narrative developments, such as meeting new confidantes, altering the composition of the Volume Deck, or even learning new lessons from the experience. Players also engage in writing letters home (e.g., to a mentor or family) on a seasonal basis, reflecting on their experiences.
