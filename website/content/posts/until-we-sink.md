Until We Sink is a collaborative, GM-less storytelling game. The setting is a diminutive, gradually submerging resort island in the Pacific Ocean. Characters are either natives or holiday guests. The game commences shortly after a fishing enthusiast is discovered dead. The narrative unfolds across five to seven "days," with each day's play centered on an evening conversation among the characters on the hotel patio. The core of the game is the collective creation of explanations for a series of mysterious and ominous events. Players select character cards, ensuring at least one or two native islanders are represented. Each "day" of game time, an event card is drawn, introducing a new mystery or occurrence (e.g., "Femur," "Mysterious free tickets"). Through their characters' dialogue during the patio conversations, players must collaboratively devise and establish explanations for these events. A critical rule is that these player-generated explanations become immutable truths within the game world; characters are forbidden from lying to submit a false explanation for an event card. An evening's conversation concludes when two characters have left the patio. The game progresses until the "The island sinks" event card is drawn, leading to a final scene where characters are adrift on a boat, and all remaining mysteries are typically resolved. The game emphasizes cooperation, with no individual winner.
