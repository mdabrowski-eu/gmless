The Wandering Library is a solo journaling role-playing game. The player takes on the persona of the proprietor of a mobile libraryâ€”which may have been acquired through purchase, construction, or inheritance. The core experience involves traveling with this library, encountering a diverse array of customers, exploring new and varied locations, and diligently tending to the library's collection of books. The game is structured to generate prompts that fuel the player's journaling and storytelling. Designed for solo play, the game requires two six-sided dice (2d6) and the player's preferred method of journaling (e.g., a notebook, digital document). Players utilize tables provided within the game rules to generate prompts. These prompts guide the exploration of different locations and the nature of encounters with various people. The player then records these adventures, character interactions, and library-related events in their journal. The game was originally created for the One-Page RPG Jam , indicating its concise design origins.
